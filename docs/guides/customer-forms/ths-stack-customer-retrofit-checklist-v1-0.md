## Appendix: Common Retrofit Scenarios

### Scenario A: Container-Based Air-Cooled (5-10 MW)
- **Typical Investment:** $400K-$550K per MW
- **Timeline:** 12-14 weeks
- **Key Upgrades:** Chilldyne CDU-1500, modular chassis, BraiinsOS+, AI platform
- **Expected Outcome:** 18.5 → 14.2 J/TH, 88% → 99% uptime

### Scenario B: Warehouse Hot/Cold Aisle (25+ MW)
- **Typical Investment:** $360K-$480K per MW
- **Timeline:** 20-24 weeks (phased by zone)
- **Key Upgrades:** Multiple CDU units, centralized cooling plant, full automation
- **Expected Outcome:** 19.2 → 13.8 J/TH, 90% → 99% uptime

### Scenario C: Partial Immersion Hybrid (10-15 MW)
- **Typical Investment:** $420K-$620K per MW (mixed zones)
- **Timeline:** 14-18 weeks
- **Key Upgrades:** Fog Hashing/HashHouse tanks (high-density), standardized management
