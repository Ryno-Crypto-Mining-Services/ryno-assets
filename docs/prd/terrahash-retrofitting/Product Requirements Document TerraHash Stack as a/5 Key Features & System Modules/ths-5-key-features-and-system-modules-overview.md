## **Module 4: Automated Treasury Management Module**

**Core Problem:** Balance BTC accumulation (wealth) vs. stablecoin liquidity (operational runway) vs. profit reinvestment (growth)

**Dynamic Allocation Engine:**

**Regime-Based Allocation:**

- **Bear (<$60K BTC):** 70-80% BTC, 20-30% stablecoin (accumulate during dips)
- **Base ($60-120K):** 50-70% BTC, 30-50% stablecoin (balanced)
- **Bull (>$150K):** 30-50% BTC, 50-70% stablecoin (lock profits)

**Operational Runway Management:**

- Target: 6-12 months of expenses covered by stablecoins
- Automated runway protection: Increase stablecoin allocation if runway <6 months
- Emergency liquidation: Sell BTC if runway <3 months

**Profit Reinvestment Optimization:**

- Bear: 10-20% reinvestment (survival mode)
- Base: 25-40% reinvestment (balanced growth)
- Bull: 15-25% reinvestment (avoid peak-cycle equipment purchases)

**Priorities:**

1. Energy efficiency improvements (reduce J/TH)
2. Replace weakest equipment cohorts
3. Expand capacity only when marginal ROI > holding BTC

**Risk Management & Hedging:**

- Hashprice hedges (lock in minimum revenue/TH)
- Difficulty futures (protect against profitability compression)
- BTC options (protect unrealized gains)
- Stablecoin yield generation (4-8% APY on idle cash)

**Custody Architecture:**

- Hot wallet: 3-7 days revenue (daily operations)
- Warm wallet: 1-2 months expenses (treasury rebalancing)
- Cold wallet: 80-90% holdings (long-term HODL)

**Tax Optimization:**

- Cost-basis tracking (LIFO/FIFO/specific ID)
- Long-term capital gains preference
- Tax-loss harvesting
- Automated 1099-MISC generation

**Expected Impact:**

- 10-20% total revenue enhancement vs. naive strategies
- Never fall below 6-month runway
- <0.3% average slippage on rebalancing trades
