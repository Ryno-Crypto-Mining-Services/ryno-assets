# 11. Open Questions & Research Priorities

<aside>
💡

- **Six critical domains:** Product, Go-to-Market, Financial, Operational, Strategic, and Regulatory questions with research methodologies and decision timelines
- **Critical 30-60 day priorities:** Validate bear market ROI viability, establish CAC/sales cycles, confirm margins (35-45% gross, 20-25% operating), optimize revenue mix (70-80% recurring target), and secure Series A ($50-100M)
- **Product uncertainties:** Unbundled vs. integrated packaging, proprietary cooling development ($5-50M investment), firmware strategy (Braiins-only vs. multi-platform), and AI feature prioritization
- **GTM challenges:** Channel strategy (direct vs. partnerships), pricing model (fixed vs. revenue-share vs. performance-based), competitive positioning, and geographic expansion timing
- **Financial targets:** 5-7 year customer lifetime with $5-15M LTV, 90%+ retention, potential debt financing ($20-40M revolving credit), and 18-24 months runway
- **Operational scaling:** Maintain 75%+ on-time delivery at 500-1,000 MW, hybrid staffing model (20-30% FTE, 70-80% contractors), and organizational evolution from functional to matrix structure
- **Strategic decisions:** Long-term vision (mining platform vs. diversified infrastructure vs. acquisition target), vertical integration (Chilldyne acquisition consideration), and AI/HPC pivot response
- **Regulatory risks:** Federal regulation probability monitoring, state-level contagion assessment, and proactive sustainability certification strategy
