<aside>
💡

- **Five comprehensive retrofit scenarios:** Container facilities, warehouse operations, multi-site portfolios, energy producer partnerships, and distressed asset turnarounds
- **Retrofit investment range:** $496-674K per MW with 4.8-16.2 month payback periods
- **Hashrate improvements:** +11% to +107% depending on baseline conditions and facility type
- **Operational efficiency gains:** 19-28% J/TH reduction, 60-75% labor cost savings, uptime improvement from 88-91% to 99%+
- **Key transformation components:** Chilldyne liquid cooling retrofit, BraiinsOS+ deployment, AI platform integration, centralized management
- **Phased implementation approach:** Pilot validation, zone-by-zone conversion, parallel deployment tracks minimize operational disruption
- **Strategic benefits:** Fleet standardization, institutional compliance (SOC2 Type II), heat recovery opportunities, asset value enhancement
- **Actionable blueprints provided:** Each use case includes baseline profiles, transformation plans, technical specs, financial analysis, and expected outcomes

## **Five Comprehensive Use Cases:**

### **USE CASE 1: Container-Based Air-Cooled Facility Retrofit**

- **Profile:** 5 MW regional operator in West Texas with seasonal throttling issues
- **Transformation:** 10 containers retrofitted with Chilldyne CDU-1500 liquid cooling
- **Results:** +36% hashrate, 16.2-month payback, eliminates $850K annual summer losses
- **Key Steps:** Phased container conversion (1 week per container), BraiinsOS+ deployment, AI platform integration

### **USE CASE 2: Large Warehouse Air-Cooled Retrofit**

- **Profile:** 25 MW institutional facility in Georgia with heterogeneous infrastructure
- **Transformation:** Zone-by-zone retrofit (5 zones), centralized cooling, unified management
- **Results:** +39% hashrate, 4.8-month payback, -65% maintenance costs
- **Key Steps:** Pilot zone validation, parallel deployment, HVAC decommissioning, fleet standardization

### **USE CASE 3: Institutional Portfolio Multi-Site Retrofit**

- **Profile:** 120 MW across 6 facilities (Texas, Wyoming, North Dakota)
- **Transformation:** 18-month phased program, fleet standardization, centralized NOC
- **Results:** +42% hashrate, 6.1-month payback, SOC2 Type II compliance, -66% labor
- **Key Steps:** Pilot + quick wins, large facility standardization, legacy site decisions, enterprise integration

### **USE CASE 4: Energy Producer Turnkey Facility Management**

- **Profile:** 18 MW hydro co-location in Montana, minimal internal mining expertise
- **Transformation:** Turnkey retrofit + managed services, heat recovery integration, SCADA automation
- **Results:** +11% hashrate, 14.7-month payback, $2.41M heat recovery revenue, -95% internal FTE
- **Key Steps:** Comprehensive assessment, retrofit + automation, operational handoff, white-glove SLA

### **USE CASE 5: Distressed Asset Rapid Turnaround**

- **Profile:** 35 MW facility acquired at bankruptcy auction, 60% operational
- **Transformation:** 90-day emergency retrofit, fixed-price contract, institutional-grade upgrade
- **Results:** +107% hashrate, 104% IRR at 12-month exit, $30M exit valuation vs. $6.3M acquisition
- **Key Steps:** Emergency stabilization, parallel equipment/infrastructure tracks, performance validation, exit preparation

## **Document Features:**

Each use case includes:

- **Baseline Facility Profile:** Current state, pain points, performance metrics
- **Detailed Transformation Plan:** Phase-by-phase breakdown with timelines
- **Technical Specifications:** Pre/post cooling systems, hardware configs, automation platforms
- **Financial Analysis:** Itemized investment, operational impact tables, ROI calculations
- **Expected Outcomes:** Performance targets, operational improvements, strategic benefits

## **Comparative Analysis Table:**

| **Use Case** | **Capacity** | **Investment** | **Cost/MW** | **Payback** | **Hashrate Gain** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Container | 5 MW | $3.37M | $674K | 16.2 mo | +36% |
| Warehouse | 25 MW | $12.98M | $519K | 4.8 mo | +39% |
| Portfolio | 116 MW | $68.0M | $586K | 6.1 mo | +42% |
| Energy Producer | 18 MW | $8.92M | $496K | 14.7 mo | +11% |
| Distressed | 31 MW | $15.9M | $634K | 12 mo | +107% |

## **Key Insights:**

- Cost range: $496-674K per MW depending on baseline conditions
- Payback periods: 4.8-16.2 months with institutional facilities fastest
- Consistent efficiency improvements: 19-28% J/TH reduction
- Labor savings: 60-75% reduction across all use cases
- Uptime improvements: 88-91% → 99%+ consistently achieved

This document provides actionable blueprints for facility operators to understand transformation pathways, investment requirements, expected timelines, and outcome validation for their specific situations.
